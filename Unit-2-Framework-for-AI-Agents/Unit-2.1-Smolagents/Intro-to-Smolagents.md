# ü§ñ Unit 2.1 ‚Äì Introduction to **smolagents**

**smolagents** is a lightweight, open-source agent framework developed by **Hugging Face**. It enables you to build capable and flexible AI agents using minimal abstraction while still supporting advanced use cases like web browsing, retrieval, and multimodal inputs.

## üéØ Unit Objective:
Learn how to build intelligent agents with smolagents that can:
- Search for information
- Execute code
- Use tools and retrieve documents
- Interact with web pages
- Leverage vision capabilities
- Work together as multi-agent systems

## üì¶ What You‚Äôll Learn

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Why Use smolagents**
- Simple yet powerful alternative to other frameworks (e.g., LangGraph, LlamaIndex)
- Best suited when:
  - You want fine-grained control
  - You prefer code generation (e.g., Python) over JSON/function calls
- Learn about its pros/cons and when to choose it

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **CodeAgents**
- These agents generate **Python code** directly
- Useful for software development, logic-heavy tasks
- Hands-on examples provided

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **ToolCallingAgents**
- These agents output **structured JSON/text** instead of code
- Easier to interpret but less flexible than CodeAgents
- Ideal for integrating tools with predictable input/output

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Tools**
- Functions that agents can call
- Defined using `Tool` class or `@tool` decorator
- Includes:
  - Creating your own tools
  - Sharing tools with the community
  - Using default or community toolboxes

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Retrieval Agents**
- Enable **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
- Can access knowledge bases and web data
- Support memory and fallback strategies for robust querying

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Multi-Agent Systems**
- Combine multiple agents for complex workflows
- Examples include connecting a web search agent with a coding agent
- Focuses on orchestration, communication, and task delegation

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ **Vision and Browser Agents**
- Use **Vision-Language Models (VLMs)** for image understanding
- Build browser agents that:
  - View web pages
  - Interpret visual content
  - Extract structured data from websites
