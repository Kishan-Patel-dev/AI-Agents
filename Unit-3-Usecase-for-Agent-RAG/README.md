## 🤖 When to Use RAG

<details>
<summary>📋 Click to expand</summary>

Use RAG when:

- You need **domain-specific knowledge** in your agent
- You want to **reduce hallucinations** in LLM responses
- You have **custom datasets** that need to be accessed
- You require **real-time information retrieval**
- You want to **maintain up-to-date information**
- You have **Memory of past interaction**.

Skip it when:
- Your use case only requires general knowledge
- You don't have a structured knowledge base
- Real-time information isn't critical
</details>

## 🔧 Key Components of RAG Systems

<details>
<summary>🔍 Click to expand</summary>

To build effective RAG systems, you need:

- **Knowledge Base** – Your custom dataset or documents
- **Retriever** – Algorithm to find relevant information
- **LLM Integration** – Combining retrieved data with LLM capabilities
- **Tool System** – Interface between agent and knowledge base
- **Query Processing** – Understanding and optimizing user queries
- **Response Generation** – Creating coherent, informed responses
</details>
