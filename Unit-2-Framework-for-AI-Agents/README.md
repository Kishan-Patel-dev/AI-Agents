## 🤖 When to Use an Agentic Framework

<details>
<summary>📋 Click to expand</summary>

Use an agentic framework when:

- You have **complex workflows** (e.g., multiple tool calls, dynamic decision-making)
- You need **abstractions** for better orchestration and modularity
- You **require features** like memory, retry logic, and error handling

Skip it when:
- You only need a simple prompt chain
- Predefined workflows are sufficient
- You want full control with less overhead
</details>

## 🔧 Key Components of Agentic Systems

<details>
<summary>🔍 Click to expand</summary>

To build robust agentic apps, you need:

- **LLM Engine** – The core brain that generates outputs
- **Tools List** – Functions or APIs the agent can use
- **Tool Call Parser** – Extracts actions from LLM output
- **System Prompt** – Coordinates agent behavior with the parser
- **Memory** – For retaining past interactions
- **Error Handling** – Retries, logs, and corrections for failed calls
</details>

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this unit, you will:

- [ ] Understand different agentic frameworks
- [ ] Implement agents using smolagents
- [ ] Build context-aware systems with LlamaIndex
- [ ] Create stateful workflows with LangGraph
- [ ] Choose the right framework for your needs
