## 🎯 Project Overview

🔗 **Check out the full project here:**
👉 [**AI Agent – RobotPai**](https://huggingface.co/spaces/kishan-patel-dev/RobotPai/tree/main)

Your final challenge is to build an AI agent that can:
- Process and understand complex queries
- Use multiple tools effectively
- Maintain context and memory
- Provide accurate and helpful responses

### 🏆 Success Criteria
- Score **90% or higher** on the GAIA benchmark
- Implement all required features
- Follow best practices
- Provide clear documentation
- Make your code reproducible

## 📊 Evaluation with GAIA

The GAIA benchmark will test your agent's capabilities:
- 20 Level 1 questions from GAIA's validation set
- Questions requiring minimal tools and fewer reasoning steps
- Real-world problem-solving scenarios
- Exact match scoring system

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Setup Your Environment:**
   - Create a new Hugging Face Space
   - Set up your development environment
   - Install required dependencies

2. **Build Your Agent:**
   - Implement core functionality
   - Add custom tools
   - Test with sample questions
   - Optimize performance

3. **Submit for Evaluation:**
   - Make your space public
   - Document your implementation
   - Submit through the API
   - Check your score on the leaderboard
