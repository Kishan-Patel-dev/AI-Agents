A practical example using **LangGraph** to email processing system. This walk-through demonstrates how to model decision-based LLM workflows without external tools.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow Overview

**Goal:** Alfred processes incoming emails to:

1. Read the email.
2. Classify as spam or legitimate.
3. Draft a response if legitimate.
4. Notify Mr. Wayne with the draft.

> üß† Note: Though LLM-powered, this is not a true agent‚Äîit's focused on LangGraph's workflow modeling.

## üì¶ Step 0: Install Dependencies

**Installing Packages**
```bash
%pip install langgraph langchain_openai
```
**Import Modules
```python
import os
from typing import TypedDict, List, Dict, Any, Optional
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage
```

---

## üìö Step 1: Define State

```python
class EmailState(TypedDict):
    # The email being processed
    email: Dict[str, Any]  # Contains subject, sender, body, etc.

    # Category of the email (inquiry, complaint, etc.)
    email_category: Optional[str]

    # Reason why the email was marked as spam
    spam_reason: Optional[str]

    # Analysis and decisions
    is_spam: Optional[bool]
    
    # Response generation
    email_draft: Optional[str]
    
    # Processing metadata
    messages: List[Dict[str, Any]]  # Track conversation with LLM for analysis
```
>üí° Tip: Make your state comprehensive enough to track all the important information, but avoid bloating it with unnecessary details.


---

## üîß Step 2: Define Node Functions

```python
# Initialize our LLM
model = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)

def read_email(state: EmailState):
    """Alfred reads and logs the incoming email"""
    email = state["email"]
    
    # Here we might do some initial preprocessing
    print(f"Alfred is processing an email from {email['sender']} with subject: {email['subject']}")
    
    # No state changes needed here
    return {}

def classify_email(state: EmailState):
    """Alfred uses an LLM to determine if the email is spam or legitimate"""
    email = state["email"]
    
    # Prepare our prompt for the LLM
    prompt = f"""
    As Alfred the butler, analyze this email and determine if it is spam or legitimate.
    
    Email:
    From: {email['sender']}
    Subject: {email['subject']}
    Body: {email['body']}
    
    First, determine if this email is spam. If it is spam, explain why.
    If it is legitimate, categorize it (inquiry, complaint, thank you, etc.).
    """
    
    # Call the LLM
    messages = [HumanMessage(content=prompt)]
    response = model.invoke(messages)
    
    # Simple logic to parse the response (in a real app, you'd want more robust parsing)
    response_text = response.content.lower()
    is_spam = "spam" in response_text and "not spam" not in response_text
    
    # Extract a reason if it's spam
    spam_reason = None
    if is_spam and "reason:" in response_text:
        spam_reason = response_text.split("reason:")[1].strip()
    
    # Determine category if legitimate
    email_category = None
    if not is_spam:
        categories = ["inquiry", "complaint", "thank you", "request", "information"]
        for category in categories:
            if category in response_text:
                email_category = category
                break
    
    # Update messages for tracking
    new_messages = state.get("messages", []) + [
        {"role": "user", "content": prompt},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": response.content}
    ]
    
    # Return state updates
    return {
        "is_spam": is_spam,
        "spam_reason": spam_reason,
        "email_category": email_category,
        "messages": new_messages
    }

def handle_spam(state: EmailState):
    """Alfred discards spam email with a note"""
    print(f"Alfred has marked the email as spam. Reason: {state['spam_reason']}")
    print("The email has been moved to the spam folder.")
    
    # We're done processing this email
    return {}

def draft_response(state: EmailState):
    """Alfred drafts a preliminary response for legitimate emails"""
    email = state["email"]
    category = state["email_category"] or "general"
    
    # Prepare our prompt for the LLM
    prompt = f"""
    As Alfred the butler, draft a polite preliminary response to this email.
    
    Email:
    From: {email['sender']}
    Subject: {email['subject']}
    Body: {email['body']}
    
    This email has been categorized as: {category}
    
    Draft a brief, professional response that Mr. Hugg can review and personalize before sending.
    """
    
    # Call the LLM
    messages = [HumanMessage(content=prompt)]
    response = model.invoke(messages)
    
    # Update messages for tracking
    new_messages = state.get("messages", []) + [
        {"role": "user", "content": prompt},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": response.content}
    ]
    
    # Return state updates
    return {
        "email_draft": response.content,
        "messages": new_messages
    }

def notify_mr_hugg(state: EmailState):
    """Alfred notifies Mr. Hugg about the email and presents the draft response"""
    email = state["email"]
    
    print("\n" + "="*50)
    print(f"Sir, you've received an email from {email['sender']}.")
    print(f"Subject: {email['subject']}")
    print(f"Category: {state['email_category']}")
    print("\nI've prepared a draft response for your review:")
    print("-"*50)
    print(state["email_draft"])
    print("="*50 + "\n")
    
    # We're done processing this email
    return {}
```

---

## üîÄ Step 3: Route Logic
Function to determine which path to take after classification:

```python
def route_email(state: EmailState) -> str:
    """Determine the next step based on spam classification"""
    if state["is_spam"]:
        return "spam"
    else:
        return "legitimate"
```
>üí° Note: This routing function is called by LangGraph to determine which edge to follow after the classification node. The return value must match one of the keys in our conditional edges mapping.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Step 4: Create the StateGraph & Define Edges
Connect everything together:

```python
# Create the graph
email_graph = StateGraph(EmailState)

# Add nodes
email_graph.add_node("read_email", read_email)
email_graph.add_node("classify_email", classify_email)
email_graph.add_node("handle_spam", handle_spam)
email_graph.add_node("draft_response", draft_response)
email_graph.add_node("notify_mr_hugg", notify_mr_hugg)

# Start the edges
email_graph.add_edge(START, "read_email")
# Add edges - defining the flow
email_graph.add_edge("read_email", "classify_email")

# Add conditional branching from classify_email
email_graph.add_conditional_edges(
    "classify_email",
    route_email,
    {
        "spam": "handle_spam",
        "legitimate": "draft_response"
    }
)

# Add the final edges
email_graph.add_edge("handle_spam", END)
email_graph.add_edge("draft_response", "notify_mr_hugg")
email_graph.add_edge("notify_mr_hugg", END)

# Compile the graph
compiled_graph = email_graph.compile()
```
> Notice how we use the special `END` node provided by LangGraph. This indicates terminal states where the workflow completes.
---

## üß™ Step 5: Run Examples

```python
# Example legitimate email
legitimate_email = {
    "sender": "john.smith@example.com",
    "subject": "Question about your services",
    "body": "Dear Mr. Hugg, I was referred to you by a colleague and I'm interested in learning more about your consulting services. Could we schedule a call next week? Best regards, John Smith"
}

# Example spam email
spam_email = {
    "sender": "winner@lottery-intl.com",
    "subject": "YOU HAVE WON $5,000,000!!!",
    "body": "CONGRATULATIONS! You have been selected as the winner of our international lottery! To claim your $5,000,000 prize, please send us your bank details and a processing fee of $100."
}

# Process the legitimate email
print("\nProcessing legitimate email...")
legitimate_result = compiled_graph.invoke({
    "email": legitimate_email,
    "is_spam": None,
    "spam_reason": None,
    "email_category": None,
    "email_draft": None,
    "messages": []
})

# Process the spam email
print("\nProcessing spam email...")
spam_result = compiled_graph.invoke({
    "email": spam_email,
    "is_spam": None,
    "spam_reason": None,
    "email_category": None,
    "email_draft": None,
    "messages": []
})
```

---

## üîç Step 6: Add Observability with Langfuse
- Use an observability tool such as [**Langfuse**](https://langfuse.com/) to trace and monitor the agent.

```bash
%pip install -q langfuse langchain
```
**Langfuse API keys & Host Address**

```python
import os
 
# Get keys for your project from the project settings page: https://cloud.langfuse.com
os.environ["LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "pk-lf-..." 
os.environ["LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY"] = "sk-lf-..."
os.environ["LANGFUSE_HOST"] = "https://cloud.langfuse.com" # üá™üá∫ EU region
# os.environ["LANGFUSE_HOST"] = "https://us.cloud.langfuse.com" # üá∫üá∏ US region
```

**Configure `Langfuse_callback_handler`**
Configure the [`Langfuse callback_handler`](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/langchain/tracing#add-langfuse-to-your-langchain-application) and instrument the agent by adding the `langfuse_callback` to the invocation of the graph: `config={"callbacks": [langfuse_handler]}`.

```python 
from langfuse.callback import CallbackHandler

# Initialize Langfuse CallbackHandler for LangGraph/Langchain (tracing)
langfuse_handler = CallbackHandler()

# Process legitimate email
legitimate_result = compiled_graph.invoke(
    input={"email": legitimate_email, "is_spam": None, "spam_reason": None, "email_category": None, "draft_response": None, "messages": []},
    config={"callbacks": [langfuse_handler]}
)
```
> Use Langfuse to trace, debug, and monitor your LangGraph workflows with real-time insights.

### Visualizing Our Graph
LangGraph allows us to visualize our workflow to better understand and debug its structure:

```python
compiled_graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()
```

## Key Takeaways
- **State Management**: We defined comprehensive state to track all aspects of email processing
- **Node Implementation**: We created functional nodes that interact with an LLM
- **Conditional Routing**: We implemented branching logic based on email classification
- **Terminal States**: We used the END node to mark completion points in our workflow
