# 🧠 From LLMs to AI Agents

In the first unit of the course, we learned that **AI Agents** go beyond simple conversation—they **plan, reason, and make autonomous decisions**.

While **LLMs** (Large Language Models) enable more natural NPC dialogue, **Agentic AI** takes this to the next level by allowing characters to:

* Make decisions
* Plan actions
* Adapt to evolving situations in real time

## 🎭 LLMs vs. Agentic AI — What’s the Difference?

Imagine a classic RPG NPC:

* **With an LLM**:
  The NPC responds to you naturally, maybe even creatively—but only when *you* initiate interaction. It remains **reactive**.

* **With Agentic AI**:
  The NPC could **seek help**, **set traps**, or **avoid you entirely**, even if you're not engaging with it. It's **proactive** and goal-driven.

> 🧩 This shift turns NPCs from **scripted responders** into **autonomous actors** with agency.

## 🔓 Unlocking Dynamic Gameplay

Agentic AI empowers NPCs with:

* **🧠 Autonomy**: Independent decision-making based on the game state
* **🌀 Adaptability**: Adjusting strategies in response to the player's behavior
* **🗂️ Persistence**: Remembering past interactions to guide future decisions

Together, these traits unlock richer, emergent storytelling and gameplay.

## ⚠️ The Trade-Off: Speed

While promising, Agentic AI comes with a **major limitation** — **latency**.

* 🐢 Agents need time to **reason and plan**
* 🕹️ This slows them down, making them unsuitable for **fast-paced games** (like Doom or Super Mario)
* 🧮 Example: *Claude Plays Pokémon*
  The number of tokens processed to think + act introduces significant lag.

> Most real-time games run at **30 FPS** — meaning agents must respond **30 times per second**. That’s not currently feasible with today's LLM-based agents.

## ✅ Turn-Based Games: The Ideal Fit

🎯 Enter **turn-based games** like Pokémon! These allow:

* Time for reasoning
* Strategic decision-making
* A perfect sandbox for experimenting with agent behavior

## 🚀 What’s Next?

In the next section, you’ll:

* Build your own **AI Agent for turn-based battles**
* Face off against it
* Even challenge other agents online

Let’s build something extraordinary together. 👾
